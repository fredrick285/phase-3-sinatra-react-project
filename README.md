# TaskPad API

This project management API is a simple web API where you make CRUD calls to a server to organize a project management app.


## Introduction

You can use this API in conjunction with my front-end project management app by git cloning to my-app-frontend repository https://github.com/fredrick285/taskpad-client.git 

## How to use 
first run  bundle exec rake server
This will connect to local server htttp://localhost:9292
then open the front end repository and run npm start to open the react app
You'll see seeded tasks and can add or edit existing tasks
